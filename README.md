This repo is a minimal reproduction of an issue where graceful Temporal worker restarts will cause some activity tasks to get dropped.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait a few moments for Temporal to initialize. You can access the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8080

## Running the Test

Run these three commands in separate terminals:

```bash
python workflow_worker.py
```

```bash
# Specify the restart interval in seconds (e.g., 1.0 second)
python activity_worker.py 1.0
```

```bash
# Specify the number of workflows to start (e.g., 500)
python start_workflows.py 500
```

## Project Structure

- `docker-compose.yml` - Temporal server configuration (PostgreSQL backend)
- `workflows.py` - Workflow and activity definitions (activity sleeps 0.1s)
- `workflow_worker.py` - Worker for processing workflows (runs continuously)
- `activity_worker.py` - Chaos worker for processing activities (restarts every N seconds)
- `start_workflows.py` - Script to start N workflows (default: 100)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (temporalio SDK)

## Issues

### Worker shutdown hangs

All tests done with 10s graceful shutdown timeout:

```bash
python activity_worker.py --graceful-shutdown-timeout 10
```

Tests:

```bash
# If activity duration > graceful shutdown timeout, shutdown hangs:
GOOD   python start_workflows.py --activity-timeout 5 --activity-sleep 8 2
BAD    python start_workflows.py --activity-timeout 5 --activity-sleep 11 2
```
